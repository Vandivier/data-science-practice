File produced: migrant-remittances.csv

OECD country data:                          http://www.oecd.org/about/membersandpartners/list-oecd-member-countries.htm
Remittance data (migrant-remittance.xls):   http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/facts/DICE/Migration/Migration/Labour-Migration/migrant-remittance.html

You can then take migrant-remittances and switch the dummy for recession to 0 for all observations during 2006 to replicate migrant-remittances-no2006.csv
