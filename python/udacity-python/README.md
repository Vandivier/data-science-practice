# Udacity-Python

Scraping Udacity user data with IP Rotation in Python.

White hat stuff only. This is for research.

Also, this is how I'm learning Python. So this readme contains a ton of links both directly relevant to the project and also generally connected to learning Python.

Note that this is related to some other projects:

1. vandivier / data-science-practice / js / udacity-study       is the origin
2. vandivier / udacity-apify                                    is mature and working, but no IP rotation
3. vandivier / data-science-practice / python / udacity-python  the latest member of the family, more a learning project than a mature useful thing

Built with Yeoman's [`generator-python`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-python).
